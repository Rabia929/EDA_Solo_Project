# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)_Solo_Project
The main purpose of the project was to find significant relationship between features and explain the statistical description of the features, for instance, how much variables are correlated with each other and how much the significant features explain why some countries rank higher than others. EDA and data visualization show the ranking of the countries corresponding to different features by using Python and Power BI.
